# Introduction #
Rockbox is an open source project that has been designed from the beginning with accessibility at its heart.

The project currently supply a utility that helps to setup Rockbox on your MP3 player. This utility is also responsible for generating the speech that allows the MP3 players content to be accessible through audio prompts.

Currently there is basic support for the Microsoft speech API in Windows. This example demonstrates the power and flexibility of Open Sapi.

This example not only extends the SAPI functionality on Windows but also to Linux and Mac allowing users of Rockbox to access hundreds of high quality text to speech engines in many languages on their preferred operating system.
